The uploaded folder itself don't get saved in the directory where the main.py python files is there. 
Only the "Folders and Files" that are inside that uploaded folder will be saved as input to that directory.

### REMEMBER
You cannot upload files, in that case upload folder, because the GUI is programmed in a way to accept only folders, so that multiple files or folders inside that folder can be used for analysis. This is done as, there can be sub-folders also while choosing some analysis. 

### Python files
The three python files are taken as sample. You may run any python file by simply changing the code file name in "script_name" variable. 
Uploaded folder's subfolder or files will be saved in the directory where the main.py python files is there. 
The output from the python file will be saved based on user's preferred location.
