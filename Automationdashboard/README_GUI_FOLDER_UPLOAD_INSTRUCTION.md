The uploaded folder itself don't get saved in the directory where the main2.py python files is there. 
Only the "Folders and Files" that are inside that uploaded folder will be saved as input to that directory.

### REMEMBER
You cannot upload files, in that case upload folder, because the GUI is programmed in a way to accept only folders, so that multiple files or folders inside that folder can be used for analysis. This is done as, there can be sub-folders also while choosing some analysis.
